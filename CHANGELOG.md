* 


0.3.0 (2014-04-14)
------------------

* Added pseudonym 'bulid' to run a complete compile
* Removed old grunt tasks no longer used


0.2.0 (2014-01-12)
------------------

* Removed individual grunt tasks. This means the entire directory needs to be parsed with every commit, but decouples the grunt tasks from specific directories. Ultimately, this makes the directory structure much more flexible.


0.1.0 (2013-12-23)
------------------

* Fix XAML clean action order.
* Add reset task to clean out the target directory before updating (forces delete of old items)
* Fix rsycn task
